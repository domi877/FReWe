# First React Website (FReWe)

My first approach with React, building a custom website.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Youâ€™ll need to have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) >= 8.10 on your local development machine

### Installing

1. Clone this repository
2. Delete the `node_modules` folder and any `lock` files such as yarn.lock or package-lock.json if present.
3. Run `npm install` in the base folder to install all dependencies

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

To learn React, check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).

## Running the tests

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
